# Welcome
**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.
I hope you like it!
I am a new developer. 
New. 
I’ve been using Jekyll to build this blog for about two and a half years. Because the site is quite simple, I’ve had plenty of time to work on the long tail of small details: stuff that makes me smile, but won’t necessarily be apparent to anyone else. This post is about one of those details.

Most people will notice that the site works well on small screens as well as big. Lots of web traffic comes from smartphones, so I made sure the design would scale down as well as up. (I think the technical term for this is responsive design.)

One effect of responsive design is that you can’t predict where line breaks will appear. To keep the text a sensible size, lines have to be different lengths on different devices – for example, 20 words fit comfortably on one line on a desktop monitor, but on a phone screen they’d be unreadably small.

Most of the time, this is fine. It doesn’t matter where the line breaks appear. But there are a handful of phrases I use regularly where a line break in the middle would be a bit annoying. Phrases like “PyCon UK”, “RFC 1234” or “part 3”. If the two words were split over multiple lines, it wouldn’t be the end of the world, but it’d be a bit annoying. It’s a digital paper cut.
