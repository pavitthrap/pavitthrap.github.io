Prototyped first interaction bot, which comments the first time a user make a post in GitHub issues, a bot that creates a monthly issue to collect newcomer feedback & provide mentorship, and a bot that posts various metrics about a given repository (such as response time, fraction of unanswered issues, etc.). </p></div>
